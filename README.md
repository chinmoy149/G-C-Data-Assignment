# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Peer-Graded-Assignment
author :- Chinmoy Das

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

Notes for using  this file :-</br>
1. Do ensure that all your required files and datasets are in the correct places.</br>
2. Now change the source of each and every file, as and when required.</br>
3. I've included the command to load the 'data.table' package, so you need not do so.</br>
4. This will create a file with the name of 'tidy_data.txt", in the 'D:' drive [if you're using Windows Operating System]</br>

Coded on RStudio 1.0.44 (for Windows x64)</br>
Using R v3.3.1 (for Windows x64)
